Ground motion module
################################

The *ground motion module* will contain functionalities for computing ground motion scalar parameters 
using ground-motion models (GMMs) implemented into the OQ Engine. 
The primary functionality required for this module is the GMMs to compute 
ground motion parameters and their associated uncertainty for scenarios of interest.
